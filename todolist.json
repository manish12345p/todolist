        "description": "A whisper carried on the breeze,\nThrough rustling leaves of ancient trees.\nA story told in shifting light,\nOf dawn's soft blush and fading night.\n\nThe river\nsings a ceaseless hum,\nWhere silver fish forever come.\nA silent dance beneath the spray,\nAs secrets drift and flow away."
